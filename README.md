Live preview for command-line tools.

*pvw* makes it easy to tweak shell
incantations by showing an interactive
preview on every key stroke.

## Features

- Show live preview of command-line output
  as you type
- Supports programs with interactive text
  interfaces, such as *vim* and *top*.

That's it! See [As Compared to
X](#as-compared-to-x) for more featureful
alternatives and [Roadmap](#roadmap) for
where *pvw* is heading.


## Installation

Pre-built packages are not available yet.

Installing from source is pretty easy if you
have [Cargo][0] setup:

```sh
$ git clone https://github.com/sullvn/pvw.git
$ cargo install --path pvw
```


## As Compared to X

*Pvw* is pretty early along, so you will
probably be better served by one of these:

- [**interactively**][1] creates a live
  preview for a shell command with
  placeholder. Requires Bash and [fzf][2].
  *pvw* does not have any placeholder
  substition features.
- [**up**][3] creates a live preview for
  the command at the end of a shell pipe.
  *pvw* does not include this functionality
  yet.


## Roadmap

1. Fix outstanding bugs
2. Publish pre-built binaries and packages
3. Create test framework
4. Support shell features in commands
5. Allow using *pvw* as part of a shell pipe 
6. Integrate [cowbox][4] for *Just Run It*
   <sup>:tm:</sup> capabilities
